## Who was Marcus Aurelius?

He was last of the 5 good emperors (reign 161-180AD) who had a lifelong interested in philosophy. 

Marcus was attracted to the school of the Stoics, an austere philosophy usually summarized by the maxim

` virtue is the only good`

Marcus wrote his thoughts for his own use, known today as the Meditations. This book is not only a valuable source of Stoic philosophy in the 2nd century AD, but a headspring for wisdom.
